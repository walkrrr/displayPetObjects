# displayPetObjects
Created with CodeSandbox
I created the factory function pattern and objects for Sharon's Pet Rescue (fictional), and I used the pet data to populate the webpage. I first took the pet objects I created and placed them in an array. By placing objects in an array, I could loop over all objects at once using the for...of loop.

When finished, a visitor will be able to click the "Show Pet Status" button to quickly see which pets are available to meet and play with. Hopefully, this will lead to some pet adoptions.
